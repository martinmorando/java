# Learning Java

## Motivations for Learning Java
- **Platform independent**: Java programs run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
- **Build Android apps**: Java is the primary language for developing Android apps.

## Running Java Programs
- Compile: use the command `javac file.java` to compile the Java source code. This generates a file named `file.class`, which contains the bytecode.
- Run: execute the program with the command `java file` (do not include the `.class` extension). The JVM interprets and runs the bytecode.
